Notes about measurement and process noise minimization: 

Measurement: 
- Used an application that automatically removed gravity from the accelerometer data.

Process: 
- Moved body with respect to the coordinate system of the phone. Avoided turning the phone as much as possible. 
- When performing hard turns, stopped for 2 seconds to zero out acceleration and velocity. 
- Started and stopped collecting data with 2 seconds standing still. 
- Minimized jumpy movement and tried to move as gently as possible.
